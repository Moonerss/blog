+ 

### preprocessing  

+ [scCancer](https://github.com/wguo-research/scCancer) a package for automated processing of single-cell RNA-seq data in cancer  
+ 

### cell type annotation  

+ [scATOMIC](https://github.com/abelson-lab/scATOMIC) Single Cell Annotation of TumOur Microenvironments In pan-Cancer  
+ [scAnno](https://github.com/liuhong-jia/scAnno) An automated annotation tool for single-cell RNA sequencing datasets primarily based on the single cell cluster levels, using a joint deconvolution strategy and logistic regression  

### Infer malignant cells  

+ [infercna](https://github.com/jlaffy/infercna) Infer Copy Number Alterations and Clonality in (Single-Cell) RNA-Seq Data  


### funtional enrichment  

+ [escape](https://github.com/ncborcherding/escape) Easy single cell analysis platform for enrichment  
+ 

### meta program  

+ [GeneNMF](https://github.com/carmonalab/GeneNMF) unsupervised discovery of gene programs in single-cell data  

### object convert  

+ [schard](https://github.com/cellgeni/schard) This package allows one to load scanpy h5ad into R as list, SingleCellExperiment or Seurat object. For now it only loads `X`, `obs`, `var`, `obsm` (as reduced dimensions) if requested and `images` for visium data. The package is based on rhdf5 for h5ad manipulation and is pure R (that is reticulate-free).
